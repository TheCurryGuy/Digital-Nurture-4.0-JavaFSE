to be honset the linear search and binary search differ significantly in terms of efficiency. tje linear search checks each product one by one until a match is found or the list ends, resulting in a time complexity of O(n). It works on both sorted and unsorted arrays but becomes slow as the number of products grows. Binary search, on the other hand, operates on a sorted array and repeatedly divides the search space in half, achieving a time complexity of O(log n). This makes it much faster, especially for large datasets.

For an e-commerce platform where performance and speed are critical, binary search is the more suitable option. Users expect quick results when searching for products, and as the product database grows, the efficiency of binary search ensures that the platform remains responsive. Although it requires maintaining a sorted list, the performance benefits outweigh the overhead, making binary search the better choice for this use case.
